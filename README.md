#### Return the percentage of a number
Write a function that takes an object with the properties number and percentage as argument
Return the given percentage of the number

#### Check if a number is even
Write a function that takes a number as argument. If the number is even, return true. Otherwise, return false

#### How many times does a character occur?
Write a function that takes a two strings as arguments. Return the number of times the first string occurs in the second string

#### Check if a number is a whole number
Write a function that takes a number as argument. If the number is a whole number (has no decimal place), return true. Otherwise, return false

#### Multiplication, division, and comparison operators
Write a function that takes two numbers, say a and b, as arguments. If a is smaller than b, divide a by b. Otherwise, multiply both numbers. Return the resulting value

#### Check whether a string contains another string and concatenate
Write a function that takes two strings, say a and b, as arguments. If a contains b, append b to the beginning of a. If not, append it to the end. Return the concatenation

#### Split a number into its digits
Write a function that takes a number as argument. The function should split the number into its individual digits and return them in an array

#### Clear up the chaos behind these strings
It seems like something happened to these strings. Can you figure out how to clear up the chaos? Write a function that joins these strings together such that they form the words 'Javascript', 'Countryside', and 'Downtown'!. You might want to apply basic JS string methods such as replace(), split(), slice() etc

#### Return the next higher prime number
This challenge is a little bit more complex. Write a function that takes a number as argument. If the number is prime, return the number. If not, return the next higher prime number

#### Find next higher natural number that is divisble by y
Write a function that takes two numbers, say x and y, as arguments. Check if x is divisible by y. If yes, return x. If not, return the next higher natural number that is divisible by y

#### Round a number to 2 decimal places
Write a function that takes a number as argument. Round the number to the 2nd digit after the comma. Return the rounded number
#### Comparison operators, strict equality
Write a function that takes two values, say a and b, as arguments. Return true if the two values are equal and of the same type
