***

#### Accessing object properties one
Write a function that takes an object with two properties as argument. It should return the value of the property with key country

#### Accessing object properties two
Write a function that takes an object with two properties as argument. It should return the value of the property with key 'prop-2'. Tipp: you might want to use the square brackets property accessor

#### Accessing object properties three
Write a function that takes a string and an object with two properties as arguments. It should return the value of the property with key equal to the value of the string

#### Remove a property from an object
Write a function that takes an object as argument. It should return an object with all original object properties but the property with key 'country'

#### Merge two objects with matching keys
Write a function that takes two objects as arguments. Unfortunately, the property 'country' in the second object has the wrong key. It should be named 'city' instead. Merge both objects and correct the wrong property name. Return the resulting object. It should have the properties 'planet', 'continent', 'country', 'state', and 'city'

#### Merge an arbitrary number of arrays
Write a function that takes arguments an arbitrary number of arrays. It should return an array containing the values of all arrays

#### Swap object keys and values
Write a function that takes an object as argument. Somehow, the properties and keys of the object got mixed up. Swap the Javascript object's key with its values and return the resulting object

#### Replace empty strings in object with null values
Write a function that takes an object as argument. Some of the property values contain empty strings. Replace empty strings and strings that contain only whitespace with null values. Return the resulting object

#### Extracting information from objects
Write a function that takes an object as argument containing properties with personal information. Extract firstName, lastName, size, and weight if available. If size or weight is given transform the value to a string. Attach the unit cm to the size. Attach the unit kg to the weight. Return a new object with all available properties that we are interested in

#### Add property to each object in array
Write a function that takes an array of objects and a string as arguments. Add a property with key 'continent' and value equal to the string to each of the objects. Return the new array of objects. Tipp: try not to mutate the original array
