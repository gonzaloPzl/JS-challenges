#### Check if value is present in Set
Write a function that takes a Set and a value as arguments. Check if the value is present in the Set

#### Convert a Set to Array
Write a function that takes a Set as argument. Convert the Set to an Array. Return the Array

#### Get union of two sets
Write a function that takes two Sets as arguments. Create the union of the two sets. Return the result.
Tipp: try not to switch to Arrays, this would slow down your code

#### Creating Javascript Sets
Write a function that takes three elements of any type as arguments. Create a Set from those elements. Return the result

#### Delete element from Set
Write a function that takes a Set and a value as argument. If existing in the Set, remove the value from the Set. Return the result

#### Add multiple elements to Set
Write a function that takes a Set and an array as arguments. If not already existing, add each element in the array to the Set. Return the modified Set

#### Get Intersection of two Javascript Sets
Write a function that takes two sets, say setA and setB, as arguments. Get the intersection of the sets. In other words, return a set containing all elements that are both in setA as well as setB
