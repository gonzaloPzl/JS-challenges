#### Check if all array elements are equal
Write a function that takes an array as argument. It should return true if all elements in the array are equal. It should return false otherwise

#### Sort an array of numbers in descending order
Write a function that takes an array of numbers as argument. It should return an array with the numbers sorted in descending order

#### Sort an array of strings alphabetically
Write a function that takes an array of strings as argument. It should return the array with its values sorted alphabetically

#### Return the average of an array of numbers
Write a function that takes an array of numbers as argument. It should return the average of the numbers

#### Return the longest string from an array of strings
Write a function that takes an array of strings as argument. It should return the longest string

#### Merge an arbitrary number of arrays
Write a function that takes arguments an arbitrary number of arrays. It should return an array containing the values of all arrays

#### Remove a specific array element
Write a function that takes an array and a value as argument. The function should clean the array from all occurrences of the given value and return the the cleaned version

#### Merge two arrays with duplicate values
Write a function that takes two arrays as arguments. Merge both arrays and remove duplicate values. Sort the merge result in ascending order. Return the resulting array

#### Sum up all array elements with values greater than
Write a function that takes an array and a number, say num, as arguments. Sum up all array elements with a value greater than num. Return the sum

#### Create a range of numbers
Write a function that takes two numbers, say min and max, as arguments. Return an array of numbers in the range min to max

#### Return last n array elements
Write a function that takes an array and a number (n) as arguments. It should return the last n array elements. If the array has less than n elements, return all
