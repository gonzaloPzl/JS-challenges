***

#### Check if all array elements are equal
Write a function that takes an array as argument. It should return true if all elements in the array are equal. It should return false otherwise

#### Sort an array of numbers in descending order
Write a function that takes an array of numbers as argument. It should return an array with the numbers sorted in descending order

#### Sort an array of strings alphabetically
Write a function that takes an array of strings as argument. It should return the array with its values sorted alphabetically

#### Return the average of an array of numbers
Write a function that takes an array of numbers as argument. It should return the average of the numbers

#### Return the longest string from an array of strings
Write a function that takes an array of strings as argument. It should return the longest string

#### Merge an arbitrary number of arrays
Write a function that takes arguments an arbitrary number of arrays. It should return an array containing the values of all arrays

#### Remove a specific array element
Write a function that takes an array and a value as argument. The function should clean the array from all occurrences of the given value and return the the cleaned version

#### Merge two arrays with duplicate values
Write a function that takes two arrays as arguments. Merge both arrays and remove duplicate values. Sort the merge result in ascending order. Return the resulting array

#### Sum up all array elements with values greater than
Write a function that takes an array and a number, say num, as arguments. Sum up all array elements with a value greater than num. Return the sum

#### Create a range of numbers
Write a function that takes two numbers, say min and max, as arguments. Return an array of numbers in the range min to max

#### Return last n array elements
Write a function that takes an array and a number (n) as arguments. It should return the last n array elements. If the array has less than n elements, return all

#### Group array of strings by first letter
Write a function that takes an array of strings as argument. Group those strings by their first letter. Return an object that contains properties with keys representing first letters. The values should be arrays of strings containing only the corresponding strings. For example, the array ['Alf', 'Alice', 'Ben'] should be transformed to. { a: ['Alf', 'Alice'], b: ['Ben']}

#### Define an array with conditional elements
Write a function that takes an array with arbitrary elements and a number as arguments. Return a new array, the first element should be either the given number itself. or zero if the number is smaller than 6. The other elements should be the elements of the original array. Try not to mutate the original array
