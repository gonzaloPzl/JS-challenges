#### Check if two dates are equal
Sounds easy, but you need to know the trick. Write a function that takes two date instances as argument. It should return true if the dates are equal. It should return false otherwise

#### Return the number of days between two dates
Write a function that takes two date instances as argument. It should return the number of days that lies between those dates

#### Check if two dates fall on the exact same day
Write a function that takes two date instances as argument. It should return true if they fall on the exact same day. It should return false otherwise

#### Check if two dates are within 1 hour from each other
Write a function that takes two date instances as argument. It should return true if the difference between the dates is less than or equal to 1 hour. It should return false otherwise

#### Check if one date is earlier than another
Write a function that takes as argument an object with the properties a and b, each containing a date instance. It should return true if date a is earlier than date b. It should return false otherwise

#### Add n days to an existing date
Write a function that takes as argument an object with the properties date and daysToAdd, containing a Javascript date and a number. It should add daysToAdd days to the date and return the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC

#### Calculate difference between two dates in hours, minutes, and seconds
This is a more difficult challenge. Write a function that takes two date instances as arguments. It should return an object with the properties 'hrs', 'min', and 'sec'. The corresponding values should display the absolute difference between the two dates in hours, minutes, and seconds

#### Return the next nearest quarter hour of a date
Write a function that takes a Date instance as argument. It should return the next nearest quarter hour in minutes. For example, if the given date has the time 10:01 the function should return 15
